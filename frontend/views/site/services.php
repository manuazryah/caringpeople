Many patients believe that if they need to consult a doctor they need to go to hospitals or clinics and wait for ages to get an appointment. However at Caring People this is not the case, our Doctors are always happy to come into your home because we believe this is where the best care can be provided. If the patient is confined due to illness, disability or when they need an urgent treatment, a home visit is the quicker and the best option ever. Using a visiting doctor saves you the hassle of going out and sitting around in a waiting room surrounded by potentially contagious illnesses. Instead you can stay in the warmth and comfort of your own home.</p>
                                                                                                        <p>All our doctors are exceptionally proficient and are usually able to give a prompt, professional diagnosis and offer the appropriate treatment on the spot. Diagnosing the problem early and receiving proper medication cut shorts the time spent unwell and can improve the speed of recovery, as the illness doesn’t have a chance to take hold. If it is not possible to identify or treat the problem immediately, our doctors will carry out further tests, or refer the patient to the appropriate specialist. We have an extensive network of contacts across the vast majority of medical disciplines. Getting the right diagnosis and treatment swiftly can have a big effect on eventual outcomes. Our Doctor Visit service is designed in such a way that you get a doctor when you want, where you want.</p>

We focus on providing patients with relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness. We work closely with each individual’s medical team to provide an extra layer of support. Palliative care can be for any person, of any age, and at any stage in a serious illness and can be provided along with curative treatment. It focuses on symptoms such as pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, constipation, nausea, loss of appetite, difficulty in sleeping and depression. It also helps you gain the strength to carry on with daily life. It improves your ability to tolerate medical treatments. And it helps you have more control over your care by improving your understanding of your choices for treatment. End of life care is for people at an advanced stage of their illness or disease. They have either chosen not to have any further treatment or they have exhausted all appropriate treatments available to them. With our expertise we are always looking at the bigger picture, so we can constantly assess and respond to any changes in care needs quickly. We know how important it is that you and your loved ones are looked after and supported through this final stage of life. By staying with the client in their own home, our Nurses will:

It affects who we are, the way we think, act, and feel. These changes can be temporary or permanent, and may cause deterioration or a complete inability to perform and function. For many, returning to their previous lifestyle is no longer possible. Most individuals living with a brain or spinal cord injury lived a full life prior to the injury, and have a full life ahead of them as well. Like all of us, they are just trying to cope with the changes and occurrences of daily life as best they can; however, they are now faced with the additional challenges that have come with their injury. If you or a loved one is faced with a longer term disability as a result of a brain or spinal cord injury, you understand the struggles of everyday living. Household tasks that were once simple become difficult and daily living requires assistance. Caring People’s live-in nurses and medical professionals have the training, education, and expertise to effectively care brain and spinal cord injury patients. We understand the challenges of brain and spinal cord injuries and have the ability to help with activities of daily living and in-home nursing needs to offer the highest level of comfort. We together with patients and their families set and reach the physical, mental, and emotional goals that provide the foundation for an independent life. Our team of professionals provide a continuum of care that encompasses:

One of our head office team will come to you at your convenience, and with you make a list of your requirements. It will be good to see you in your own home, so that we can help to make you as comfortable as possible during your care. We can view with you your medication list, any disabilities, what you like to eat, where the carer will stay etc. You might have pets which need caring for and that is fine too.

Your comfort and wellbeing is our priority. We will also calculate costs with you and tailor make your package accordingly. Rest assured that we will work with you at your level, listening to any family members you would like involved in this planning. The package can be quickly arranged and your care package can be in place within a few days or at your leisure.
