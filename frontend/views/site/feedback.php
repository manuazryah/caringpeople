We keep a record of all salutations that are received. Your compliment will be passed on to the related team, or individual. You can also compliment the team or individual directly. We would like to hear from you if you have any recommendations about how we can progress our services.

                                                    Any concerns that you have are often best dealt with when they arise, so we would encourage you to first explain your problem to the management. In many cases, it should be possible to sort out the problem straight away by talking to a manager.

We take complaints very seriously. We aim to resolve complaints quickly, confidentially and fairly and try to sort out any mistake or misunderstanding straight away.

                                                    It is helpful if you make a complaint as soon as possible after the event. This will enable us to investigate the issues effectively. The period of time where we can investigate is within one month of the incident or one month of you, or a family member, noticing something is not quite right.
