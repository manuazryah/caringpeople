We focus on providing patients with relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness. We work closely with each individual’s medical team to provide an extra layer of support. Palliative care can be for any person, of any age, and at any stage in a serious illness and can be provided along with curative treatment. It focuses on symptoms such as pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, constipation, nausea, loss of appetite, difficulty in sleeping and depression. It also helps you gain the strength to carry on with daily life. It improves your ability to tolerate medical treatments. And it helps you have more control over your care by improving your understanding of your choices for treatment. End of life care is for people at an advanced stage of their illness or disease. They have either chosen not to have any further treatment or they have exhausted all appropriate treatments available to them. With our expertise we are always looking at the bigger picture, so we can constantly assess and respond to any changes in care needs quickly. We know how important it is that you and your loved ones are looked after and supported through this final stage of life. By staying with the client in their own home, our Nurses will:

It affects who we are, the way we think, act, and feel. These changes can be temporary or permanent, and may cause deterioration or a complete inability to perform and function. For many, returning to their previous lifestyle is no longer possible. Most individuals living with a brain or spinal cord injury lived a full life prior to the injury, and have a full life ahead of them as well. Like all of us, they are just trying to cope with the changes and occurrences of daily life as best they can; however, they are now faced with the additional challenges that have come with their injury. If you or a loved one is faced with a longer term disability as a result of a brain or spinal cord injury, you understand the struggles of everyday living. Household tasks that were once simple become difficult and daily living requires assistance. Caring People’s live-in nurses and medical professionals have the training, education, and expertise to effectively care brain and spinal cord injury patients.

Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia. People with Alzheimer’s can struggle with memory loss, mood changes and problems with communication and reasoning and they often feel vulnerable and helpless.The severity of dementia has a wide scale, but symptoms of dementia will usually get gradually worse.  The speed with which this occurs will depend on the general health or the person and on the type of dementia they have.

Although dementia can seem like a challenging issue to face for families, with the right professional live-in care and support those with it can still enjoy an active, happy and fulfilling life in their own homes.At Caring People we are actively trying to improve the options for people with dementia to remain at home. Homecare is often an overlooked option.  Yet it is a viable and often preferable option for people with dementia compared to moving into residential nursing care or to similar sort of settings.

It’s a role that requires 100 per cent commitment, and a lot of selflessness. No matter how committed you are to the needs of the person you’re caring for, you also need to make time for yourself.Caring People’s home respite care services enable carers to ensure their loved ones receive the help and support they need whilst they take a short break from their roles.

Respite for carers can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks away from the role. So, this short break will enable you to return to caring feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Our respite services see warm and friendly temporary carers go into the homes of people affected by a range of conditions to provide short term care. In the past years as a provider of home care, we’ve delivered respite support for the carers of elderly people, Dementia respite care, and much more.
                                                                        </p>

There are worries over disruption to existing routines, and lifestyle. Our short term carers recognise the importance of planning any temporary care. They will communicate with you to ensure that your loved one’s medical and lifestyle requirements are met during your absence.
