One of our head office team will come to you at your convenience, and with you make a list of your requirements. It will be good to see you in your own home, so that we can help to make you as comfortable as possible during your care. We can view with you your medication list, any disabilities, what you like to eat, where the carer will stay etc. You might have pets which need caring for and that is fine too.
